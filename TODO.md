# 0.2.0 release

## done

* change licence to AGPL
* url parameters to pre-select fields
    - need to match these fields to the slugified field names
        - field names are no longer slugified from the labels but tied to field order in csv
    - need to ensure field names can be specified explicitly in case the column string ever changes
        - don't want urls in message boards with broken parameters
            - field names are no longer slugified from the labels but tied to field order in csv
            - field name drift is now less likely to happen
    - done
        - added a permalink widget that will always get you back to your selection

## todo bucket

* update address bar with selected field changes so user can use 'back' button to undo selections
* add simplified no-javascript rendering
    - is this even possible in a SLA?
    - just a static will do
* replace booleans with ticks and crosses
    - preserve text label in dropdown
    - tick with caveat? 
        - "  âœ“*  "
        - looks kinda shit
* group results
    - recursive grouping is fun, but lets limit this to one group at a time
        - 'platform' I think
* determine user's platform based on user agent (if windows, select windows, etc)
    - perhaps a standard platform profile? 
        - a 'windows' profile gets unambiguous windows 'yes', 'gui'
        - a 'linux' profile gets ambiguous linux 'yes*', 'f/oss' yes, etc
